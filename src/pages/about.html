					This page is if you want to know more about me.<br>
					<br>
					My name is Eric Snyder. I graduated from Georgia Institute of Technology with a BS degree of Science in Mechanical Engineering in 2014.
					I do not work as a mechanical engineer. I did that for about 1 year after I gruaduated and did a coop job in it; I did not like it.
					I've always wanted to make games, so eventually I switched over to programming because I knew programming was involved in making video games.
					Ever since then (2016), I've been programming in bunsiness software for a day job, and trying to make games on the side.
					<br>
					<br>
					I don't want to explain the rest...I'll probably come back to this when I feel like it. It involves the year I took off in 2015 to make a game engine, and my mentor 
					Joe who inspired me to start making video games.
