					<p>
						My name is Eric Snyder. I have been a full stack web developer since 2016 and currently am trying to switch to game making. I graduated from Georgia Institute of Technology in 2014 with a bachelor degree of Science in Mechanical Engineering. My degree is in Mechanical Engineering, but I switched to programming in 2016 because I dislike and am not good at Mechanical Engineering. My web development career started in 2016, but I've been doing game related projects on the side as a hobby since 2010.

						The screen name I use everywhere is “Miles_Gloriosus”. So if you see that screen name in a game or username on a website, its probably me.

					<span class="homeSubheader">How I started</span>
					<p>
						I've always played video games since I was little (18 months old according to my mom). And like most people in this generation, I grew up on TV/Internet/video games. I also always wanted to make games since I was little, but never had the attention span to learn how to program. After high school, I attended Georgia Tech and chose to study mechanical engineering. I chose mechanical engineering because my parents said I was good at math, and my uncles were all engineers and they were paid decent amount of money. Like everyone else around that time, I didn't really know what I was doing.
					</p>
					<p>
					While I was at Georgia Tech, I did a co-op program while getting my degree with a company called NEETRAC in 2010. My intention was to find out what engineers REALLY did at work (since I was studying it all this time). It was at NEETRAC where my boss, Joe Goldenburg, inspired me to learn how to program and make video games. Joe was a Mechanical Engineer with 15+ years experience (or something like that), and he eventually mentored me throughout my co-op terms. He wasn't a professional programmer and I don't think he played any games. There was a conversation I had with Joe within the first week of meeting him, and that conversation is what started my on my path of programming/games. 
					</p>

					<p>
					One day at work, in an alcove meeting room, Joe asked me “Why are you studying to be a mechanical engineer?” I responded with something like “I don't really know, but I do like how things mechanically worked and I'm good at math. And I know from my family that engineers get paid decent money, so I figured I should get a career in mechanical engineering.” Joe then asked if I have done any side projects or engineering projects at home, and I have not. He then asked “So you're studying for a mechanical engineering degree, but you haven't done any engineering projects on your own. How do you know if you like it if you haven't done anything?”. And I couldn't really answer him. My original intention of co-op was to see what a mechanical engineers job was really like. I never really had any intrinsic motivation to do that stuff myself, like take apart a device to see how it worked, or construct something for the fun of it.
					</p>

					<p>
					So then, Joe asked this question “What would you be doing right now if you were not studying to be a mechanical engineer?” I told him I would rather be making video games. Then Joe asked if I have done any side game projects at home, and I have not. He then asked “So you want to make video games, but you haven't done any game projects on your own. How do you know if you like it if you haven't done anything?” And again, I didn't really have an answer for him.
					</p>

					<p>
					That conversation really stuck with me. I think that was the first point when I realized I didn't know what I wanted. Joe asked the same set of questions, one set relating to a career I had no interest in (mechanical engineering), and one relating to a career where I was VERY interested in (game making), and both had the same outcome: I didn't know if I liked it. Or if I was even good at it.
					</p>

					<p>
					After that, Joe talked about the working world and how people usually have to make a choice: mix their passions/dreams with work, or keep them separated. I'm paraphrasing here, because I don't remember exactly what he said, and my views on this have evolved over time. 
					</p>

					<p>
					But generally, if you combine the work with your passion, you may end up hating what you loved in the first place. However, if you do mix them, you end up spending a lot more time in something you enjoy. It  helps you to grow/evolve the passion over time, instead of just treating it as a hobby. A musician or artist is the classic example of this. A guy who makes music in his spare time has a lot of fun with it, but then if he has to work with it for a living, he gets sick of it. 
					</p>

					<p>
					If you choose to keep your passions and work separate, you don't have to risk losing interest in your passion. However, your passion is most likely doomed to be hobby. Sometimes you get lucky and you could make it big, but because you don't invest your time fully into it, it usually just becomes side projects that you work on and doesn't go anywhere beyond that. 
					</p>

					<p>
					Joe talked about other things as well, but those were the main points. Anyway, after the hour long talk, Joe told me this “I want you to make me a game. I want it to be the biggest, most advanced controlled, graphically stunning game ever. Best AI ever, and I want multiplayer for all consoles.” He was being facetious if you coldn't tell. “I want to play your game.”
					</p>

					<p>
					After that day, I picked up my quick start C book, and learned enough C in 3 months to make him a pong clone game; I called it JoePong. I used Win32 API for the application layer and graphics (used lots of bitblt'ing). Also used windows sounds for when the ball bounced off the walls/paddles because I couldn't figure out how to get sounds to work with Win32 API. It was a crude game, but it did have multiplayer and AI. It wasn't the “most advanced controls” game that Joe wanted, but when I showed it to him, he said he was impressed that I actually went through with it. I was very happy.
					</p>

					<p>
					And ever since then, I couldn't stop. I picked up C++ to try and make other games. Stumbled upon something called “game engines”, and tried to make my own engine in C++ so I can make a bunch of games with it. Made a little side project called Goblin Fighters that ran on my own engine. I used SDL libraries for the graphics. Its a very VERY crappy engine btw; barely even qualified. I got a couple goblins jumping around a tiled 2d side scroller. But I learned about entity/component architecture, “blob” architecture (basically a “blob” parent class that has a shit ton of members on it), physics, collision detection (fast and slow), sprite sheets/slicing, cameras, data driving architecture...just about anything related to game making I came across on the internet I tried to learn about.
					</p>

					<p>
					I also wanted to know how multiplayer games worked, because I knew eventually I will want to make one. So I made a little chat room in C++, and learned about sockets. I used UDP sockets for the chat, and I made it so you could draw together with another person. (btw, if you want to know how multiplayer games work, I started with Glen Fiedler on his GafferOnGames site: https://gafferongames.com/post/udp_vs_tcp/ . He's a very good teacher, and makes things very simplistic on the overviews. And dives into VERY complex things when he shows examples. But an excellent resource if you want to know how multiplayer games work.)
					</p>

					<p>
					Eventually I made the decision to officially switch from mechanical engineering completely as a career choice, and decided to go with software programming instead. I decided to go with business software as a career instead of game software for various reasons. I'm not going to go into those for now....maybe later.
