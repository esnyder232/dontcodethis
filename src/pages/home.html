								Prototype for Unity Game
							</div>
							<div class="blogListDate">
								Started: 1/2020. Abandoned: 7/2020
							</div>
							<div class="blogListShortSummary">
								I want to make a small prototype of the game I want to make. Something that shows the basic gameplay; probably something that can be completed in 5 minutes.
								I don't have many plans for it, except its a side scrolling hack and slash game and I'm going to build it in Unity 3D.
								This eventually was abandoned because I was tired of Unity's conventions and complications. Its so tied to the editor, its hard to programatically get anything done.
								More info if you want to read it:

								A cytube clone I made for Broteam. I don't really work on it anymore. I "maintain" it, but its basically been passed on to another developer. Its here: <a target="blank" href="https://coolhole.org">https://coolhole.org</a>

						There are probably other small projects I've worked on, but I can't remember them right now...or they're integrated with some other project or something. 
						Kind of like the Postgres sql import/export program I made in a couple days. Its integrated with this site, and I'm too lazy to unintegrate it.
