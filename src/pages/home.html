							<div class="blogListShortSummary">
								I want to make a small prototype of the game I want to make. Something that shows the basic gameplay; probably something that can be completed in 5 minutes.
								I don't have many plans for it, except its a side scrolling hack and slash game and I'm going to build it in Unity 3D.

						There are probably other small projects I've worked on, but I can't remember them right now...or they're integrated with some other project or something. 
						Kind of like the Postgres sql import/export program I made in a couple days. Its integrated with this site, and I'm too lazy to unintegrate it.
